# Google page project

This project was part of The Odin Project to build a replica of the Google homepage. 

This was the first time replicating a site. I learned to how to use flexboxes the nav bar, the main google search section, and the footer. 

For the google search form and buttons, I had to figure out how to force the search bar to be on one line and the buttons to be on a line below. This was solved by using an hr and hiding the element.

For the nav bar, I found it pretty difficult to use flexboxes and have 2 flex items be on the left of the browser and the other 4 flex items to be on the right of the browser. This was solved by creating 2 separate ul -- one for the right and the other for the left. This finding also helped when it came time to create the footer.
